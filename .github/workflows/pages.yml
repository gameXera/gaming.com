<h3>what is minecraft</h3>

<u><i><b>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios.<br>
<u><i><b>The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming <br>
<u><i><b>language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first<br>
<u><i><b> made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with<br>
<u><i><b> Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft <br>
<u><i><b>has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game<br>
<u><i><b> of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active users as of 2021.<br>
<u><i><b>In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain and<br>
<u><i><b>may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and simple machines.<br>
<u><i><b> Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other <br>
<u><i><b>players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build the world<br>
<u><i><b> and maintain health) and a creative mode (where players have unlimited resources and access to flight). Players can modify <br>

<u><i><b>the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.<br>
<u><i><b>Minecraft received critical acclaim, winning several awards and later being cited as one of <br>
<u><i><b>the greatest video games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual<br>
<u><i><b> Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational <br>
<u><i><b>environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual<br>
<u><i><b> property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Several spin-offs have also been made, including Minecraft: Story<br>
<u><i><b> Mode (which has since been shut down on all platforms except Netflix, where only the first five episodes are available),<br>
<u><i><b> Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Earth (which has since also been shut down), and—in 2023—Minecraft Legends.<br>
